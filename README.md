Overview
This project aims to detect keypoints on human faces from images using a trained neural network. The detection of keypoints can be used in various applications like expression analysis, facial recognition, and tracking in videos.

Features
Preprocessing pipeline for facial images.
Neural network for keypoint detection.
Visualization of predictions.
Setup and Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Download additional data/models:

Usage
Prepare your data:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory (or configure the path in the script).
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook facial_keypoints_detection.ipynb
Train the model or load a pretrained version and evaluate it on test data.

Data
The dataset contains annotated facial images with keypoints labeled. If you're using a public dataset, add its source here.

Model Architecture
The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from images and predict keypoints.

Input: Grayscale facial images
Layers: Convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers
Output: Predicted keypoints as (x, y) coordinates
Results
Add evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or examples of predicted keypoints vs. ground truth.
